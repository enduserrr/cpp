# TEMPLATES
Templates allow using placeholder types instead of specific types and compiler generates the actual code for specified types only when they are used. Enables code reusability due to not being limited to a singular specific type of data for a given function.

## Ex00
* Swap: Swaps values between two given params
* Min: Returns the smaller one of two given params (the second one if equal)
* Max: Returns the larger one of two given params (the second one if equal)

Template allows using placeholder type T instead of specific pre determined data types.
=> Enables reusing code as data type type gets defined by compiler per use case

Subscript operators allows objjects of a class to be accessed using array like syntax at a given point specified with a key or an index.

## Ex01 Iter
A generic function template with three args: a ptr to an array address, array length and a function to aply on it.

## Ex02 Array
Subscript operator allows objects of a class to be accessed using array like syntax at a given point specified with a key or an index.

## FIX
* new line ex01
* complex types ex00
* filenames
